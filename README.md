# Building a Full-Text Search App Using Docker and Elasticsearch

author: Li Jie

email:  jie.n.li@nokia-sbell.com

In this tutorial, we'll walk through setting up our own full-text search application (of an admittedly lesser complexity than the systems in the questions above).  Our example app will provide a UI and API to search the complete texts of 100 literary classics such as *ClearQuest*, *Wiki*, and *Web Library*.


This application is 100% open-source, feel free to utilize the code however you would like.
